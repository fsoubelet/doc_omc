# The Kmod GUI

The Kmod GUI provides functionality to perform [K-Modulation][kmod_method] either as a full IP trim or through an individual magnet circuit, in the form of a graphical interface.
It also has the ability to extract and analyze data from previous trims.

This site will guide you through the GUI's layout and functionality.
For starters, check out [the basics of running the GUI][gui_basics].

Alternatively, take a look at the [procedure for performing K-modulation in the CCC][kmod_measurements].
