# PyLHC Tools

[This package][repo] is a collection of useful scripts and tools for the Optics Measurements and Corrections group (OMC) at CERN.
It provides tools which can be useful for working with accelerators, but are not necessary for optics measurements analysis.

## Functionality

- [*Forced DA Analysis*](forced_da.md) - Script to analyse forced DA.
- [*Machine Settings Info*](machine_settings_info.md) - Prints an overview over the machine settings at a given time.
- [*BSRT Logger* and *BSRT Analysis*](bsrt.md) - Saves data coming straight from LHC BSRT FESA class and allows subsequent analysis.
- [*BPM Calibration*](bpm_calibration.md) - Script to compute the calibration factors for the LHC BPMs.

## Documentation

- [Autogenerated docs][documentation] via ``sphinx``.

## Getting Started

This  package is `Python 3.7+` compatible, but not yet deployed to PyPI.
The best way to install is through pip and VCS:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pylhc/PyLHC
pip install /path/to/PyLHC
```

Or simply from the online master branch, which is stable:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/pylhc/PyLHC.git#egg=pylhc
```

After installing, codes can be run with either `python -m pylhc.SCRIPT --FLAG ARGUMENT` or calling path to the `.py` file directly.

Note: some of the scripts access functionality only available on the CERN Technical Network.
To use those, you should make sure to install the relevant extra dependencies with `pip install path/to/Pylhc[tech]`.
