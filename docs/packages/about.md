# The OMC Python Ecosystem

This section of the website goes over our Python computing and analysis softwares and environments.
Our main software for optics analysis exists in two versions: a legacy Python 2 version, `Beta-Beat.src`, and its Python 3 successor `omc3`.
Development of `Beta-Beat.src` is limited to bug fixes while new features are reserved for `omc3`.

Our other packages provide useful tools and scripts for our day-to-day work as well as specific I/O functionality and entrypoint utilities for our codes.
All our Python codes, including legacy repositories, can be found on the [PyLHC organisation][pylhc_github]{target=_blank}'s page on Github.

## The OMC Production Environments

The OMC Python 3 production environment for use for instance in the CCC is based on the CERN BE/CO [Acc-Py][accpy_docs]{target=_blank .cern_internal} distribution, although an OMC-specific one.
The environment, along with many of our important files, is located in the `/afs/cern.ch/eng/sl/lintrack/` directory on `afs`.

The environment is located at `/afs/cern.ch/eng/sl/lintrack/omc_python3/` and can be used in two different ways:

- Activate the environment (`source /afs/cern.ch/eng/sl/lintrack/omc_python3/bin/activate`) then run `python` to execute your programs.
- Point to the Python executable directly (`/afs/cern.ch/eng/sl/lintrack/omc_python3/bin/python`) to execute your programs.

!!! warning "Modifying the Environment"
    Please do not try to modify this environment.
    Should you need specific packages, reach out to us or consider [setting up your own environment](development/howto_venv.md#creating-virtual-environments-with-acc-py) from our `Acc-Py` distribution.

??? question "Python 2 Environment"
    We do have a `miniconda2` installation in `lintrack` for legacy Python2 codes.
    This distribution is frozen and the use of Python 2 codes should be avoided as much as possible.
