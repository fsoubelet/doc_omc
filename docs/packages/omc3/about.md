# The OMC3 Software Documentation

The `omc3` package is the python tool of the Optics Measurements and Corrections team at CERN.
The `omc3` repository is the new version of our codes, refactored and rewritten for `Python 3.7+`.

!!! info ""
    This section acts as a general documentation and guide to using the `omc3` package.
    The package's source can be found on [Github][omc3_gh]{target=_blank} and its API documentation can be found at the [following link][omc3_doc]{target=_blank}.

## What to expect

The `omc3` package serves the following purposes:

- Providing an all-in-one package for frequency analysis and optics measurements and corrections algorithms in particle accelerators.
- Providing an easily callable entrypoint to run your analytics from measurement / simulation files.
- Providing a convenient wrapper to effortlessly run `MAD-X` jobs.

For installation instructions and detailed content see the [getting started guide](getting_started.md).
For a step by step walk-through of an `omc3` analysis workflow, see the [workflow guide](analysis.md).
