This page provides quick access links to logbook entries of important OMC shifts or measurements done during the LHC 2023 commissioning and MDs.
Some entries (underlined) offer a tooltip when hovered, with a quick description of the important information from that entry.
The tables below can be sorted by clicking next to the column headers.

<!-- Tooltips -->
*[Injection Linear Optics]:  Corrections with total phase-advance. DA comparison with MO and chroma (improved!). Injection optics with former (2021) corrections validated, fine corrections for normalized dispersion.
*[Ramp and Squeeze Linear Optics]: Measurements and validation of optics from 200cm down to 30cm, including K-Mod. First new corrections at 120cm, applied from 200cm to 120cm. Bad IP8. All others agree well with corrections from the 2023 MD last year. 
*[Measurements in the Ramp + Validation]: Measurements in the Ramp, Validation of 120cm optics with corrections done on 2023-04-05 to lower IP8 beating. 
*[a4 Corrections at 30cm]: Measurement of the f1012 and f1210 RDTs and corrections tests at 30cm. Some K-Mod measurement at 87cm.
*[NL Studies at Injection]: Measurement of several RDTs with and without landau octupoles with both 2022 and 2023 optics.
*[Ions Virgin Optics]: Got ions optics to 50cm at IP2. Minor local coupling correction attempted, not very convincing. This is poorly documented in the logbook.
*[Ions Optics Validation]: Implemented new local corrs at IP2. Trimmed energy to be the same as nominal. Calculated global corrections and re-measured for validation.
*[High Beta Optics Validation]: Measured and validated high beta optics (120m). Did some global corrections, beta-beating below 4% in the end. K-mod done but not used.
*[MO response at Injection]: Measurements of RDTs with/without global MCO correction for Q'', then measurements at K_MO=+2,-2,-1; then with 2 configs of detuning neutral MO with alternating +/- strengths for the aim of checking impact of detuning on RDT measurement reliability, and to check shift of skew octupole RDT with MO powering.
