<!-- Tooltips -->

*[Injection Optics Global Corrs]: Measured virgin machine at injection optics then did global corrections and local coupling corrections. Reached similar performance as previous years.
*[30cm Local Corrs and Injection Meas]: Squeezed to 30cm and iterated on the "guessed" IR1 local correction to find a good one. Went back to injection optics for decay measurements, Dy, total phase advance corrections & f1020 corrections.
*[Injection Linear and NL Chroma]: Iteration on the global correction phase at injection, attempts at Dy correction and NL / chromatic measurements.
*[Inj. Global w/o kq5, f1020 and b5-RDT Corrs]: Iteration on the global correction, removing kq5.l2b1. Testing impact of f1020 correction on RDT, amplitude detuning, and beam lifetime. Study of octupoles and sextupoles on b5 RDT.
*[Nonlinear Corrections at 30cm - 1]: Tested old global corrs at 2m and 1.2m which work. New ones will be needed at 60cm, 30cm and 20cm. ML local corrections did good. Xing scan in IP1 to check feed-down from IR, correction overcompensates detuning.
*[Nonlinear Corrections at injection]: Measurements for b3 decay, 3Qy corrections, NL chroma, MO knobs effects & MO RDTs response to coupling, and B2 Dy correction attempts.
*[Nonlinear Corrections at 30cm - 2]: Validation of new IP1 b4 correction. IP1 sextupole corrections via crossing angle scans. Validation of b4,b3,a3 corrections via crossing angle scans and amplitude detuning measurements at flat-orbit and nominal crossing. Check of 2024 b6 correction.
*[Global Corrections in the Squeeze]: Determined global corrections at 60cm and 30cm. Re-measured for validation, good results.
*[Measurements in the Ramp]: Measured the optics in the ramp, then down from 2m to 30cm. Beam 1 good. Beam 2 results in squeeze deviated from Friday due to an energy shift, which was fixed with a 1E-4 trim. New global corrections were determined and applied for Beam 2. Did some Kmod.
*[Squeeze validation and NL optics]: Validated optics from 60cm to 30cm. Some new corrections computed for 60cm. Validated K-mod at 60cm, 45cm and 30cm. Measured b4 corrections effect using flat orbit to kick as high as possible.
